# iOS App #1

Xcode 7.0 beta 3 and Swift 2.0

First app is a calculator to convert your catâ€™s age in human years to cat years.

This was mostly about basic plumbing, but interesting things to note:
1. Includes an image (many thanks to my daughter Bridget!)
2. Sets custom background color to blend with included image
3. Handles input errors

Here's the screenshot of the running app:
